David DM badges
===============

Please mind the changed behaviour for David DM buttons.

        rm:david → now completes to Dependencies badge
    rm:david_dev → completes to devDependencies badge

Now you can also apply a flat style to your badge, for the old behaviour,
simply delete the style parameter from the URL.
