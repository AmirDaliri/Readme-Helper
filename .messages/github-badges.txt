GitHub badges
=============

As of this version, all of the triggers for GitHub badges have been renamed:

              rm:follow → rm:github_follow
        rm:follow_count → rm:github_follow_count
                rm:fork → rm:github_fork
          rm:fork_count → rm:github_fork_count
                rm:star → rm:github_star
          rm:star_count → rm:github_star_count
    rm:star_large_count → rm:github_star_large_count

If you're used to the old triggers, you should still be able to use them thanks
to Sublime Text's fuzzy search.
