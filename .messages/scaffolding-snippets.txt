Scaffolding snippets
====================

As of this version, all of the triggers to scaffold README files have been modified:

       rm:node → rm:scaffold_node
    rm:sublime → rm:scaffold_sublimetext

If you're used to the old triggers, you should still be able to use them thanks
to Sublime Text's fuzzy search.

There is also a new snippet for Grunt packages:

    rm:scaffold_grunt

Enjoy!
